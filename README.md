## Abstract
 In the past few years, various advancements have been made in generative models owing to the formulation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs have been shown to perform exceedingly well on a wide variety of tasks pertaining to image generation and style transfer. In the field of Natural Language Processing, word embeddings such as word2vec and GLoVe are state-of-the-art methods for applying neural network models on textual data. Attempts have been made for utilizing GANs with word embeddings for text generation. This work presents an approach to text generation using Skip-Thought sentence embeddings in conjunction with GANs based on gradient penalty functions and f-measures. The results of using sentence embeddings with GANs for generating text conditioned on input information are comparable to the approaches where word embeddings are used.
